Hey, this is my Portfolio page.
Currently there is only a game I have created on here but I will hopefully have one up soon :)
This game was created as a project for a university class using GODOT
The game was designed as a way to interactively use data from a library database which was Minor (a person who mines) injuries and deaths
Enjoy!!
